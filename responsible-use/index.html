            <h3>The Link Between Ethics and Law</h3>
            <p>
              There is a virtual cycle between data ethics and law, brought about by globalization and the localized nature of laws. Where ethical concerns within a region accelerate faster than other areas, legislators create laws that provide protections deemed necessary by citizens. These laws often provide templates for other regions, potentially influencing prevailing regional ethical concerns. In the case of data privacy, GDPR has provided a template that many countries have adapted, resulting in a framework of rights that have found their way into legal frameworks for privacy. The following rights broadly capture these concerns. Three laws were referred to in order that commonality across regions could be confirmed. These were the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and Australian Privacy Act. Where a right is included in these laws, it is indicated under the corresponding right.

            <h3>The Right of Access</h3>
            <p>
              The Right of Access gives individuals the right to obtain a copy of the personal information held about them. It also includes supplementary information such as the purpose of processing, categories of personal data processed, recipients or categories of recipients, the right to object and instructions on how, and the existence of automated decision taking based on the information held.

            <h3>The Right to Know</h3>
            <p>
              The Right to Know gives people the right to be informed about the collection and use of an individualâ€™s personal data, which extends to a number of additional obligations by the manager of that data. Additional obligations include identification of data managers and protection officers, processing purposes and interests pursued, intention to transfer and the intended recipients, duration of storage, and rights of the data subject including the ability to withdraw consent.

            <p>
              The Right to be Forgotten is the right to request erasure of data. If the data has been made public, or passed onto to third parties, all reasonable measures must be taken to inform recipients that all copies of the data originating from their disclosure must be erased.

              The Right to Opt-out is the right to revoke access to collection of more data, or the use of existing data for the purposes originally consented to (e.g., direct marketing).

            <h3>Geolocation specifically</h3>
            <p>
              CCPA goes further from a location perspective, including geolocation in the definition of personal information. This has given rise to a number of additional responsibilities for data managers. Privacy policies require updating to reflect any capture of geolocation. Users should be required to opt-in with just-in-time notice prior to collection of geolocation. CCPA requires this consent to be provided separately to any general End User License Agreement, privacy policy, conditions of use, or similar document. To comply with the Act, collection of geolocation can only commence after a data manager can prove that consent to collect (and transmit if applicable) was given, that consent was not later withheld or revoked, and that the captured geolocation precision is not greater than the precision for which consent was given.

        <h2>The Role of the Regulator</h2>
        <p>
          As discussed in section 2.2, ethics and law guide each other. Particularly in times where public or personal safety are concerned, ethical lines can grey with regard to the sharing of location data, as was evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019. Here, the role of the regulator is to outline what controls may be necessary to ensure that individuals are protected from harm and breach of privacy.
        </p>
          <p>
            Other grey examples include tweets during crises that can be used to actually detect the crisis. The US Geological Survey Tweet Earthquake Dispatch analysis social media, and uses geolocation combined with machine learning to detect earthquakes. This analysis is capable of detecting earthquakes faster than conventional scientific instruments which can take up to 20 minutes to perform the same task, albeit more accurately. However, the release of information that provides a location of activities conducted by a particular target group could be used maliciously. For example, geolocation of dating apps could be used by a predator to find common meetup spots where women will be isolated and may not be able to identify them as strangers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Location is often used as the means of achieving data integration. This too has its risks. Data which cannot otherwise be linked together can be using the location dimension, and in a way that helps a subject to be identified that might otherwise not be.
          </p>
          <p>
            The role of regulators is to provide the guard rails that help provide confidence to users that their data will be protected, and to developers that they know their responsibilities as data managers.

            <h3>Integrating Authorities (Australia)</h3>
            <p>
                Australia has had the concept of Integrating Authorities for some time. These organisations undergo accreditation to ensure that the processes they follow to integrate Commonwealth data create accurate matches, whilst at the same time preserve the privacy of the subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whilst restricted to integration of Commonwealth of Australia data, the accreditation provides reasonable guidelines for good practice for integrating data.
